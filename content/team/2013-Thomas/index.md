My first student!

He finished a MSc thesis about oroclines in the Iberian Variscides using a multidisciplinar approach.

He is probably the most unlucky person I have ever met. We broke the drill during fieldwork. His samples were lost for two months. The drill in the cutting room broke when he was preparing samples... but at the end he overcame all unfortunateÂ events and performed a great thesis. His work is part of three papers, one publised in Geology!
