Patricia will test investigate with numerical models if we can learn (1) how tectonic settings such as subduction, delamination, collision, and extension control the pathways of mantle fluids; (2) What roles mantle plumes and instabilities play in driving fluid flow in the absence of plate movement; and to simulate these
processes to better understand their dynamics and predict their impacts in real-world tectonic settings?
