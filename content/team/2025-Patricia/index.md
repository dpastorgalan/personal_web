Patricia's project "Bottom-up fluid flow: the role of lithospheric anisotropies and plate tectonics" will test through numerical modeling distinct tectonic scenarios from the simple configurations to progressively advancing to complex simulations that replicate real-world tectonic scenarios in which she will explore the influence of tectonics and plate boundaries-lithospheric structures into the mantle derived fluid pathways.
