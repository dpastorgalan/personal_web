Rafa is working with paleomagnetic and structural data from the Sierra Madre Oriental in MÃ©xico. The results are an impressive series of vertical axis rotations that define an orocline that changes dramatically the way we have seen the Pacific tectonics. After a rather hectic and unlucky begining of a thesis that includes a global pandemic and the tragic murder of his supervisor and my dear friend Roberto Molina-Garza.

The first Rafa's paper was published in 2024 in JGR: Solid Earth, and he is at present working to finish his PhD along other publications.
