Rafa is working with paleomagnetic and structural data from the Sierra Madre Oriental in MÃ©xico. The results are an impressive series of vertical axis rotations that define an orocline that changes dramatically the way we have seen the Pacific tectonics. After a rather hectic and unlucky begining of a thesis that includes a global pandemic and the tragic murder of his supervisor and my dear friend Roberto Molina-Garza it seems that we are now in track to produce an excellent piece of work.
