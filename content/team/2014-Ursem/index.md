IT always rain on Ireland, Bart. Keep that in mind. I'll keep in mind that they drive on the other side of the road. Bart worked with me in a project to understand the role of Ireland during the amalgamation of Pangea. His contribution was very important for the paper:
Extending the Cantabrian Orocline to two continents (from Gondwana to Laurussia). Paleomagnetism from South Ireland. Earth and Planetary Science Letters, 432, pp.223-231, DOI: 10.1016/j.epsl.2015.10.019
