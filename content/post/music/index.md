## Because not everything is science
Music has always been a huge part of my life. I studied clarinet and singing at the conservatory for about 14 years. While I’ve got a soft spot for classical music, my playlists bounce from jazz to death metal. And of course, being a geologist, what I listen to the most is rock! Whether it’s figuring out ancient tectonics or jamming to some good ol’ rock, it’s all about finding that rhythm!

I present here some of my music-science projects, loads of fun and skipping editorial comments...

### Acknowledgements
Rock stars want to live forever (right, Gallaghers?), and we all wish our favorite ones could stay with us as long as possible. As a geologist, I’ve learned how to understand life that’s no longer here through fossils. So, I decided to “fossilize” my favorite rock stars, some of them who have recently passed, by honoring them in the acknowledgements of my papers. Here they are.

#### 1. The Beatles
I’ve honored The Fab Four on two occasions: once on the 50th anniversary of Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band and again on the 50th anniversary of their breakup.

3. [Dylan's Nobel](https://danielpastorgalan.com/publication/2019-pastor-galan-igr/)

I celebrated more that Dylan got a Nobel than Dylan himself. That was not difficult, of course.
