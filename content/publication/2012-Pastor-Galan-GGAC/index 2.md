abstract: The behavior and evolution of mantle lithosphere during tectonic events is not yet fully understood. In addition, while some processes, such as continental collision or subduction are better known, other features like orocline formation or lithospheric mantle removal are poorly understood. We report a series of analogue modeling experiments that study the influence of gravity in a lithospheric root.The preliminary results obtained in the experiments suggest that a thick mantle lithospheric root detach in a mechanism combining delamination and dripping. The obtained results are useful to understand the late stage process that thicken the lithosphere as it is interpreted to have happened in the Ibero Armorican Arc, Vrancea arc, Sierra Nevada or New Zealand.
