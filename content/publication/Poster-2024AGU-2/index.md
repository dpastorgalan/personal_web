abstract: "Paleomagnetism.org is an open-source, web-based platform designed for the analysis and interpretation of paleomagnetic data. It offers a comprehensive suite of tools for paleomagnetic and rock magnetic research, making it accessible to both experts and beginners. Nine AGUs ago, we presented the 1.0 version of the software, and four years ago, we published a paper in G-cubed on the 2.0 version. In 2024, we have been working on improving, correcting, and adding new features to Paleomagnetism.org. We welcome your questions, queries, and suggestions for further enhancing this tool. Here, we present a synthesis of the functions of Paleomagnetism.org: Interpretation Portal: This portal allows for principal component analysis on visualized demagnetization diagrams. Users can combine interpreted directions and great circles to find solutions, which can then be used in the Statistics Portal or exported as data and figures. Statistics Portal: Here, users can perform Fisher statistics for directions and VGPs, fold tests, Common Mean Direction tests, and test for inclination shallowing in sediments. The portal now also includes inclination-only statistics. Geography Portal: This portal enables testing of paleomagnetic data against global apparent polar wander paths, rotated to the coordinates of the main plates, and allows for magnetostratigraphy analysis. Miscellaneous Portal: The final portal includes tools for direction-to-pole calculations, net tectonic rotation (NTR) analysis to restore a body to its paleo-vertical, a bootstrapped oroclinal test using linear regression techniques, and a sunshade to declination tool. Paleomagnetism.org is designed to be compatible with various data formats commonly used in paleomagnetic studies. It can export data for MagIC."
