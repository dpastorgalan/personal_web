He finished MSc project about the Pyrenees+Irelanda fighting against COVID pandemic, terrible weather in Utrecht (but fantastic tap water), and his own background (environmetal sciences). Despite everything he managed to have an outstanding performance being able to produce really high quality datasets at the same time that he became an actual solid Earth scientist!
